# weather-report

## Included Files
  - weather.py: A python program asking for a zipcode and returning relevant weather data
  - weather_test.py: A currently empty test file for weather.py
  - durham.json: A json object for testing

## Notes
  - The information loads fairly quickly, and I found putting the information into
  a single class worked better than separating the classes/data categories.
